# Fantasy Football Analytics

This repository contains a collection of notebooks for various topics related to fantasy football. Currently, the following notebooks are completed:
* Wins above replacement for each player
* How does a running backs career snap count affect their performance

# Wins Above Replacement

The wins above replacement metric is my attempt to analyze a players "value" to a fantasy team. The concept is that each player contributes an amount to the win percentage each week based on their performance. Determining this value is difficult, however, because there can be so many different combinations of teams. In order to simplify the analysis, we'll need to control for the players performance by considering the rest of the team is made up of average starters. Similarily for the opponent, their entire team will be made up of average starters.
